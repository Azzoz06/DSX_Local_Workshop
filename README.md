# Developing Analytics and Machine Learning applications in a Collaborative Environment

## About this lab
In this lab you will learn how to develop analytics and machine learning applications using different tools in DSX Local: Jupyter, Zeppelin, RStudio, and SPSS Modeler. The lab has been divided into several stand-alone parts for those who are interested in a certain develpment tool. For example, you can chose to complete just a Jupyter lab, or just an SPSS Modeler lab. 

## About this repository
This repository contains several lab subfolders. Some labs include just notebooks and data, while others have additional instructions that are located in the *Lab Instructions* folder. 

## Prerequisites
1. To run this lab, you need an instance of DSX Local. **Please note that while most code is the same between DSX Local and DSX Cloud, the notebooks included in this project will work in DSX Local only**
2. Download and unzip this [this repository](https://codeload.github.com/elenalowery/DSX_Local_Workshop/zip/master). Unzip the repository only, not files in subfolders. 

### Setting up lab projects in DSX Local
1. Rename **DSX_Local_Workshop.zip** located in **DSX_Local_Projects** folder of the unzipped repository to a unique name, for example, add your initials.    *Note: Project names in DSX Local cluster must be unique. When we create a project "from file", the project name is inherited from the file name* 
2. Log in to DSX Local
3. Select "Create New Project" and select "From File"
4. Browse to the .zip file
5. After the project has been imported, follow instructions in the notebooks.
